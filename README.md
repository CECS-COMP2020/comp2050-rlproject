# comp2050-rlproject
Reinforcement learning project for class Artificial Intelligence COMP2050 - VinUni.

### Description

In this project, we implement two crucial agents and one additional agent, which are used to solve 3 reinforcement learning problems:
 
* **Value Iteration Agent**, for solving a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a fully observable stochastic grid world.
* **Q-learning Agent**, for training the simulated crawler bot to learn how to move forward, and for playing Pacman puzzle.
* **Approximate Q-learning Agent**, for playing Pacman puzzle, which gives better result than the casual Q-learning Agent, according to our examination.

We would use the supporting material from the course CS188: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project3.html
