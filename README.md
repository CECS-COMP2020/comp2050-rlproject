Reinforcement learning project for class Artificial Intelligence COMP2050 - VinUni.
### Description

Crawler bot: 

The idea of the Crawler Bot is from the Berkeley AI course project CS188. A clear description of the bot can be find here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiXS7vROBEg&t=812s

Basically, the bot is structured as below :

where we can adjust the angle which is colored in red. The aim is to use Q-learning to make the bot move forward as effective as possible. 

We would use the supporting material from the course CS188: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project3.html
